# Flycatcher_spermatogenesis2
This repository contains the R code and files to reproduce analysis of: "Single-Cell Transcriptomics reveals rapid divergence of genes guiding meiosis and spermiogenesis in two passerine birds"

The two markdown files are the ones needed to reproduce the downstream analysis after processing with cellranger and velocyto. There are 2 files used to do the marker comparisons with humans and mouse. They are available in the original publication of Hermann et al. 2018.

Clustering_DS1DS2.Rmd is the file to start with.

The .loom and .rds files are too big to be posted here but will be made available upon request, just send an email to: carolina.segami@duke.edu. All other files needed are provided here.
